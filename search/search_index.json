To be valid, mask must either be the same size as Img.img OR the same size as Img.getgridsize() (i.e. the size of a single image volume of a multi-echo/multi-measurement stack), in which case, the single mask is simply copied such that the assigned Img.Hdr.MaskingImage always possesses the same dimensions as Img.img Details Attribute Value Static false Abstract false Sealed false ExplicitConversion false Hidden false Access : public InputNames : Img, mask OutputNames : [N/A] DefiningClass : MaRdI segmentspinalcanal Synopsis : SEGMENTSPINALCANAL segment T2* multiecho data using the Spinal Cord Toolbox (must be installed + in path) [ mask, weights ] = SEGMENTSPINALCANAL( Img, Params ) Params .dataLoadDir DICOM folder .dataSaveDir .isUsingPropsegCsf [default = false] NOTE The protocol is basically that of Topfer R, et al.

In general, RESLICEIMG() uses MATLAB's scatteredInterpolant class. The exception is when the image input (Img.img) is 2d and the target output (prescribed by inputs X,Y,Z) is a volume. This scenario is incompatible with scatteredInterpolant, and nearest-neighbor substitution is used instead. Basic Usage [] = RESLICEIMG( Img, X, Y, Z ) [] = RESLICEIMG( Img, X, Y, Z, mask ) Inputs: X, Y, Z: 2d or 3d arrays (size=output image grid) describing the X, Y, Z patient coordinates (i.e. of the DICOM reference coordinate system) of the target (output) voxels. In general, if one is interpolating from one image grid (Img) to another (MaRdI-type object Img2), these arrays are obtained by the call: [X,Y,Z] = Img2.getvoxelpositions() mask: [Optional, default = true(size output image grid)] A logical array (size=output image grid) specifying the subset of the output voxels that are of interest. (i.e. voxels in the output image with a corresponding mask entry == FALSE will simply be assigned zero). Note: Specifying the region of interest for extrapolation with this variable can greatly accelerate the interpolation! Advanced Usage TODO [F] = RESLICEIMG( Img, X, Y, Z, mask, F ) case: interpolationMethod [default='linear'] is a string supported by the scatteredInterpolant constructor.

Description Function compares an acquired image (typically, a time-series of multiple images) and an auxiliary recording (e.g. respiratory trace, ideally featuring synchronization triggers) and returns (copies to Img.Aux) an estimate of the Aux recording corresponding to each image measurement. Cases: 1. Single measurement Aux: The value is copied across all image time points 2. Single measurement Img: If Aux possesses multiple measurements, the image is presumed to have been taken during a breath-hold. In this case, the Aux signal variance is calculated over a shifting time-window (width = total image acquisition time) and the median Aux value over the window pertaining to the least variance is returned. (Length of Aux recording must be >= total scan time). 3. Img and Aux are both time-series: Length of Aux recording must be >= length of the image time-series. 3.0: Img and Aux time-points already correspond: Aux is simply copied. 3.1: Aux recording possesses a single synchronization trigger: The trigger is assumed to correspond to the first image in the time series. Aux is cropped and linearly interpolated. 3.2: Aux recording possesses multiple synchronization triggers: NOT IMPLEMENTED 3.3: Aux recording does not possess triggers: DEPRECATED .......

In general, RESLICEIMG() uses MATLAB's scatteredInterpolant class. The exception is when the image input (Img.img) is 2d and the target output (prescribed by inputs X,Y,Z) is a volume. This scenario is incompatible with scatteredInterpolant, and nearest-neighbor substitution is used instead. Basic Usage [] = RESLICEIMG( Img, X, Y, Z ) [] = RESLICEIMG( Img, X, Y, Z, mask ) Inputs: X, Y, Z: 2d or 3d arrays (size=output image grid) describing the X, Y, Z patient coordinates (i.e. of the DICOM reference coordinate system) of the target (output) voxels. In general, if one is interpolating from one image grid (Img) to another (MaRdI-type object Img2), these arrays are obtained by the call: [X,Y,Z] = Img2.getvoxelpositions() mask: [Optional, default = true(size output image grid)] A logical array (size=output image grid) specifying the subset of the output voxels that are of interest. (i.e. voxels in the output image with a corresponding mask entry == FALSE will simply be assigned zero). Note: Specifying the region of interest for extrapolation with this variable can greatly accelerate the interpolation! Advanced Usage TODO [F] = RESLICEIMG( Img, X, Y, Z, mask, F ) case: interpolationMethod [default='linear'] is a string supported by the scatteredInterpolant constructor.

(Length of Aux recording must be >= total scan time). 3. Img and Aux are both time-series: Length of Aux recording must be >= length of the image time-series. 3.0: Img and Aux time-points already correspond: Aux is simply copied. 3.1: Aux recording possesses a single synchronization trigger: The trigger is assumed to correspond to the first image in the time series.

Cases: 1. Single measurement Aux: The value is copied across all image time points 2. Single measurement Img: If Aux possesses multiple measurements, the image is presumed to have been taken during a breath-hold. In this case, the Aux signal variance is calculated over a shifting time-window (width = total image acquisition time) and the median Aux value over the window pertaining to the least variance is returned. (Length of Aux recording must be >= total scan time). 3. Img and Aux are both time-series: Length of Aux recording must be >= length of the image time-series. 3.0: Img and Aux time-points already correspond: Aux is simply copied. 3.1: Aux recording possesses a single synchronization trigger: The trigger is assumed to correspond to the first image in the time series.

NOTE: ShimOpt_Sim was written for a specific design project: Lopez Rios et al. Integrated AC / DC coil and dipole Tx array for 7T MRI of the spinal cord. In: Proc. 27th Annu. Meet. ISMRM, Montreal, Canada, 2019. Abstr. 0220. Until now, this has been its only application! Hence, some methods are likely deprecated and others overly specific to that one project. Considerable adaptation is probably in order to render the class up-to-date (i.e. compatible with the rest of the realtime_shimming library) and properly general. Nevertheless, a few methods may be of more or less immediate + general applicability, e.g. see ShimOpt_Sim.cadtopumcin( ): A routine to reformat a text file from AutoCAD describing a set of coil geometries into PUMCIN format.

(i.e. voxels in the output image with a corresponding mask entry == FALSE will simply be assigned zero).

Description Function compares an acquired image (typically, a time-series of multiple images) and an auxiliary recording (e.g. respiratory trace, ideally featuring synchronization triggers) and returns (copies to Img.Aux) an estimate of the Aux recording corresponding to each image measurement. Cases: 1. Single measurement Aux: The value is copied across all image time points 2. Single measurement Img: If Aux possesses multiple measurements, the image is presumed to have been taken during a breath-hold. In this case, the Aux signal variance is calculated over a shifting time-window (width = total image acquisition time) and the median Aux value over the window pertaining to the least variance is returned. (Length of Aux recording must be >= total scan time). 3. Img and Aux are both time-series: Length of Aux recording must be >= length of the image time-series. 3.0: Img and Aux time-points already correspond: Aux is simply copied. 3.1: Aux recording possesses a single synchronization trigger: The trigger is assumed to correspond to the first image in the time series. Aux is cropped and linearly interpolated. 3.2: Aux recording possesses multiple synchronization triggers: NOT IMPLEMENTED 3.3: Aux recording does not possess triggers: DEPRECATED .......

ISMRM, Montreal, Canada, 2019. Abstr. 0220. Until now, this has been its only application! Hence, some methods are likely deprecated and others overly specific to that one project. Considerable adaptation is probably in order to render the class up-to-date (i.e. compatible with the rest of the realtime_shimming library) and properly general. Nevertheless, a few methods may be of more or less immediate + general applicability, e.g. see ShimOpt_Sim.cadtopumcin( ): A routine to reformat a text file from AutoCAD describing a set of coil geometries into PUMCIN format.

See ShimOpt documentation for general usage. ....... Usage Shim = ShimOpt_SphericalHarmonics( Field ) Shim = ShimOpt_SphericalHarmonics( Field, Params ) As for other ShimOpt objects, Field is a MaRdI-type object representing the Field to be shimmed. The only difference is the (optional) input struct Params, for which 2 (mutually exclusive) fields are configurable: Params.ordersToGenerate : default = [1:2] If set, this generates arbitary/ideal spherical harmonics. .ordersToGenerate is a linear sequence of non-negative integers specifying the orders of spherical harmonics to be generated and placed along the 4th dimension of the array Shim.img e.g. default of [1:2], Shim.img will have 8 shim terms (three 1st-order, five 2nd-order harmonics) with values defined at the voxel positions of the input Field object. For more info, See doc ShimOpt_SphericalHarmonics.generatebasisfields Params.systemName : default = [] If set to 'IUGM_Prisma_fit' or 'HGM_Prisma', the returned Shim object possesses analogous terms to the respective Prisma scanner, with identical ordering along the 4th dimension of Shim.img, i.e. increments along this dimension correspond to X, Y, Z, Z2, ZX, ZY, X2-Y2, and XY terms respectively. The difference between the resulting ShimOpt_SphericalHarmonics object and the corresponding ShimOpt_x_PrismaX object is that the shim terms of the former are *ideally* generated as opposed to empirically mapped. .......

This scenario is incompatible with scatteredInterpolant, and nearest-neighbor substitution is used instead. Basic Usage [] = RESLICEIMG( Img, X, Y, Z ) [] = RESLICEIMG( Img, X, Y, Z, mask ) Inputs: X, Y, Z: 2d or 3d arrays (size=output image grid) describing the X, Y, Z patient coordinates (i.e. of the DICOM reference coordinate system) of the target (output) voxels. In general, if one is interpolating from one image grid (Img) to another (MaRdI-type object Img2), these arrays are obtained by the call: [X,Y,Z] = Img2.getvoxelpositions() mask: [Optional, default = true(size output image grid)] A logical array (size=output image grid) specifying the subset of the output voxels that are of interest. (i.e. voxels in the output image with a corresponding mask entry == FALSE will simply be assigned zero). Note: Specifying the region of interest for extrapolation with this variable can greatly accelerate the interpolation! Advanced Usage TODO [F] = RESLICEIMG( Img, X, Y, Z, mask, F ) case: interpolationMethod [default='linear'] is a string supported by the scatteredInterpolant constructor.

See ShimOpt documentation for general usage. ....... Usage Shim = ShimOpt_SphericalHarmonics( Field ) Shim = ShimOpt_SphericalHarmonics( Field, Params ) As for other ShimOpt objects, Field is a MaRdI-type object representing the Field to be shimmed. The only difference is the (optional) input struct Params, for which 2 (mutually exclusive) fields are configurable: Params.ordersToGenerate : default = [1:2] If set, this generates arbitary/ideal spherical harmonics. .ordersToGenerate is a linear sequence of non-negative integers specifying the orders of spherical harmonics to be generated and placed along the 4th dimension of the array Shim.img e.g. default of [1:2], Shim.img will have 8 shim terms (three 1st-order, five 2nd-order harmonics) with values defined at the voxel positions of the input Field object. For more info, See doc ShimOpt_SphericalHarmonics.generatebasisfields Params.systemName : default = [] If set to 'IUGM_Prisma_fit' or 'HGM_Prisma', the returned Shim object possesses analogous terms to the respective Prisma scanner, with identical ordering along the 4th dimension of Shim.img, i.e. increments along this dimension correspond to X, Y, Z, Z2, ZX, ZY, X2-Y2, and XY terms respectively. The difference between the resulting ShimOpt_SphericalHarmonics object and the corresponding ShimOpt_x_PrismaX object is that the shim terms of the former are *ideally* generated as opposed to empirically mapped. .......

Basic Usage [] = RESLICEIMG( Img, X, Y, Z ) [] = RESLICEIMG( Img, X, Y, Z, mask ) Inputs: X, Y, Z: 2d or 3d arrays (size=output image grid) describing the X, Y, Z patient coordinates (i.e. of the DICOM reference coordinate system) of the target (output) voxels. In general, if one is interpolating from one image grid (Img) to another (MaRdI-type object Img2), these arrays are obtained by the call: [X,Y,Z] = Img2.getvoxelpositions() mask: [Optional, default = true(size output image grid)] A logical array (size=output image grid) specifying the subset of the output voxels that are of interest. (i.e. voxels in the output image with a corresponding mask entry == FALSE will simply be assigned zero). Note: Specifying the region of interest for extrapolation with this variable can greatly accelerate the interpolation! Advanced Usage TODO [F] = RESLICEIMG( Img, X, Y, Z, mask, F ) case: interpolationMethod [default='linear'] is a string supported by the scatteredInterpolant constructor.

In general, RESLICEIMG() uses MATLAB's scatteredInterpolant class. The exception is when the image input (Img.img) is 2d and the target output (prescribed by inputs X,Y,Z) is a volume. This scenario is incompatible with scatteredInterpolant, and nearest-neighbor substitution is used instead. Basic Usage [] = RESLICEIMG( Img, X, Y, Z ) [] = RESLICEIMG( Img, X, Y, Z, mask ) Inputs: X, Y, Z: 2d or 3d arrays (size=output image grid) describing the X, Y, Z patient coordinates (i.e. of the DICOM reference coordinate system) of the target (output) voxels. In general, if one is interpolating from one image grid (Img) to another (MaRdI-type object Img2), these arrays are obtained by the call: [X,Y,Z] = Img2.getvoxelpositions() mask: [Optional, default = true(size output image grid)] A logical array (size=output image grid) specifying the subset of the output voxels that are of interest. (i.e. voxels in the output image with a corresponding mask entry == FALSE will simply be assigned zero). Note: Specifying the region of interest for extrapolation with this variable can greatly accelerate the interpolation! Advanced Usage TODO [F] = RESLICEIMG( Img, X, Y, Z, mask, F ) case: interpolationMethod [default='linear'] is a string supported by the scatteredInterpolant constructor.

Description Function compares an acquired image (typically, a time-series of multiple images) and an auxiliary recording (e.g. respiratory trace, ideally featuring synchronization triggers) and returns (copies to Img.Aux) an estimate of the Aux recording corresponding to each image measurement. Cases: 1. Single measurement Aux: The value is copied across all image time points 2. Single measurement Img: If Aux possesses multiple measurements, the image is presumed to have been taken during a breath-hold. In this case, the Aux signal variance is calculated over a shifting time-window (width = total image acquisition time) and the median Aux value over the window pertaining to the least variance is returned. (Length of Aux recording must be >= total scan time). 3. Img and Aux are both time-series: Length of Aux recording must be >= length of the image time-series. 3.0: Img and Aux time-points already correspond: Aux is simply copied. 3.1: Aux recording possesses a single synchronization trigger: The trigger is assumed to correspond to the first image in the time series. Aux is cropped and linearly interpolated. 3.2: Aux recording possesses multiple synchronization triggers: NOT IMPLEMENTED 3.3: Aux recording does not possess triggers: DEPRECATED .......

For EPI this may be stored in the DICOM field (0019, 1028). This is equivalent to the inverse of the \"effective echo spacing\", divided by the size of the image matrix in the phase encode dimension. R The in-plane acceleration factor. nPhaseEncode The actual size (e.g. # rows or columns) of the reconstructed image in the phase encode dimension (i.e. this will be greater or equal to the acquired number of phase encode lines, which depends on partial Fourier + parallel imaging) echoSpacing The actual inter-echo spacing (time between the k_x = 0 crossing of one phase encode line, to the zero-crossing on the next line).

In general, if one is interpolating from one image grid (Img) to another (MaRdI-type object Img2), these arrays are obtained by the call: [X,Y,Z] = Img2.getvoxelpositions() mask: [Optional, default = true(size output image grid)] A logical array (size=output image grid) specifying the subset of the output voxels that are of interest. (i.e. voxels in the output image with a corresponding mask entry == FALSE will simply be assigned zero). Note: Specifying the region of interest for extrapolation with this variable can greatly accelerate the interpolation! Advanced Usage TODO [F] = RESLICEIMG( Img, X, Y, Z, mask, F ) case: interpolationMethod [default='linear'] is a string supported by the scatteredInterpolant constructor.

This scenario is incompatible with scatteredInterpolant, and nearest-neighbor substitution is used instead. Basic Usage [] = RESLICEIMG( Img, X, Y, Z ) [] = RESLICEIMG( Img, X, Y, Z, mask ) Inputs: X, Y, Z: 2d or 3d arrays (size=output image grid) describing the X, Y, Z patient coordinates (i.e. of the DICOM reference coordinate system) of the target (output) voxels. In general, if one is interpolating from one image grid (Img) to another (MaRdI-type object Img2), these arrays are obtained by the call: [X,Y,Z] = Img2.getvoxelpositions() mask: [Optional, default = true(size output image grid)] A logical array (size=output image grid) specifying the subset of the output voxels that are of interest. (i.e. voxels in the output image with a corresponding mask entry == FALSE will simply be assigned zero). Note: Specifying the region of interest for extrapolation with this variable can greatly accelerate the interpolation! Advanced Usage TODO [F] = RESLICEIMG( Img, X, Y, Z, mask, F ) case: interpolationMethod [default='linear'] is a string supported by the scatteredInterpolant constructor.

Usage P = ProbeTracking() ; P = ProbeTracking( Specs ) ; When called without arguments, ProbeTracking will attempt to find a connected probe device (in /dev/) based on a set of known device names (operating system and station dependent). [TODO: Add KnownDevices.m ?] If a device is discovered, by default and if properly configured (see NOTE [1]), a second (\"daemon\") MATLAB session is launched in the background to record continuously from the device. To record and display the signal at any given moment, the user calls P.recordphysiosignal(), which reads back the live recording from the daemon session through a shared memory-mapping. A graphical STOP button appears which, when pressed, ends this windowed recording and saves it to file without ending the background recording (so P.recordphysiosignal() can be called again). For more options, type: help ProbeTracking.recordphysiosignal P = ProbeTracking( Specs ) ; Specs.isRecordingDaemonEnabled (bool) true: device I/O (probe recording) and signal processing are performed in a secondary background/daemon MATLAB session. User session can still monitor the live recording with Probe.recordphysiosignal() false: device I/O and signal processing is done in the same session. This is useful for debugging. For dual recording (e.g., pressure + capacitive probe), do the following: Plug both probes, then launch the deamon for one probe: P = ProbeTracking(); Then, create a new structure with portName of the 2nd probe: AuxSpecs.portName = 'tty.usbmodem4873121' (find the proper port address under /dev after plugging the usb) Create a new object (daemon): C = ProbeTracking(AuxSpecs) To record with both probes: P.recordphysiosignal(C) ....... NOTE [1]: The daemon configuration requires 3 things: 1. The file '~/startup.m' must exist and you must add the realtime_shimming_repository directory to the MATLAB path, e.g. addpath( genpath( '~/Code/realtime_shimming_repository/' ) ) ; 2. For #3 to work, matlab needs to exist in the system path, e.g. add the following lines (adapted to refer to your version of MATLAB) to ~/.bash_profile (or ~/.bashrc) # add MATLAB path export PATH=$PATH:/Applications/MATLAB_R2015a.app/bin/ 3.

Usage P = ProbeTracking() ; P = ProbeTracking( Specs ) ; When called without arguments, ProbeTracking will attempt to find a connected probe device (in /dev/) based on a set of known device names (operating system and station dependent). [TODO: Add KnownDevices.m ?] If a device is discovered, by default and if properly configured (see NOTE [1]), a second (\"daemon\") MATLAB session is launched in the background to record continuously from the device. To record and display the signal at any given moment, the user calls P.recordphysiosignal(), which reads back the live recording from the daemon session through a shared memory-mapping. A graphical STOP button appears which, when pressed, ends this windowed recording and saves it to file without ending the background recording (so P.recordphysiosignal() can be called again). For more options, type: help ProbeTracking.recordphysiosignal P = ProbeTracking( Specs ) ; Specs.isRecordingDaemonEnabled (bool) true: device I/O (probe recording) and signal processing are performed in a secondary background/daemon MATLAB session. User session can still monitor the live recording with Probe.recordphysiosignal() false: device I/O and signal processing is done in the same session. This is useful for debugging. For dual recording (e.g., pressure + capacitive probe), do the following: Plug both probes, then launch the deamon for one probe: P = ProbeTracking(); Then, create a new structure with portName of the 2nd probe: AuxSpecs.portName = 'tty.usbmodem4873121' (find the proper port address under /dev after plugging the usb) Create a new object (daemon): C = ProbeTracking(AuxSpecs) To record with both probes: P.recordphysiosignal(C) ....... NOTE [1]: The daemon configuration requires 3 things: 1. The file '~/startup.m' must exist and you must add the realtime_shimming_repository directory to the MATLAB path, e.g. addpath( genpath( '~/Code/realtime_shimming_repository/' ) ) ; 2. For #3 to work, matlab needs to exist in the system path, e.g. add the following lines (adapted to refer to your version of MATLAB) to ~/.bash_profile (or ~/.bashrc) # add MATLAB path export PATH=$PATH:/Applications/MATLAB_R2015a.app/bin/ 3. The user needs to start their MATLAB session from the command line, and from their home folder, e.g. user@polymtl ~ $ matlab & .......

You may notice that MATLAB has a function called 'imtransform.m' for 2D spatial transformation.

In addition, if you adjust the 'new_elem_size' parameter, this 'affine.m' is equivalent to 'interp2.m' for 2D image, and equivalent to 'interp3.m' for 3D volume. Usage: [new_img new_M] = ... affine(old_img, old_M, [new_elem_size], [verbose], [bg], [method]); old_img - original 2D image or 3D volume. We assume x for the 1st dimension, y for the 2nd dimension, and z for the 3rd dimension. old_M - a 3x3 2D affine matrix for 2D image, or a 4x4 3D affine matrix for 3D volume.

We assume x for the 1st dimension y for the 2nd dimension, and z for the 3rd dimension. 'new_elem_size' is 1 if it is default or empty. You can increase its value to decrease the resampling rate, and make the 2D image or 3D volume more coarse. It works just like 'interp3'. verbose (optional) - 1, 0 1: show transforming progress in percentage 2: progress will not be displayed 'verbose' is 1 if it is default or empty. bg (optional) - background voxel intensity in any extra corner that is caused by the interpolation. 0 in most cases.

In addition, if you adjust the 'new_elem_size' parameter, this 'affine.m' is equivalent to 'interp2.m' for 2D image, and equivalent to 'interp3.m' for 3D volume. Usage: [new_img new_M] = ... affine(old_img, old_M, [new_elem_size], [verbose], [bg], [method]); old_img - original 2D image or 3D volume. We assume x for the 1st dimension, y for the 2nd dimension, and z for the 3rd dimension. old_M - a 3x3 2D affine matrix for 2D image, or a 4x4 3D affine matrix for 3D volume. We assume x for the 1st dimension, y for the 2nd dimension, and z for the 3rd dimension. new_elem_size (optional) - size of voxel along x y z direction for a transformed 3D volume, or size of pixel along x y for a transformed 2D image. We assume x for the 1st dimension y for the 2nd dimension, and z for the 3rd dimension. 'new_elem_size' is 1 if it is default or empty. You can increase its value to decrease the resampling rate, and make the 2D image or 3D volume more coarse. It works just like 'interp3'. verbose (optional) - 1, 0 1: show transforming progress in percentage 2: progress will not be displayed 'verbose' is 1 if it is default or empty. bg (optional) - background voxel intensity in any extra corner that is caused by the interpolation. 0 in most cases. If it is default or empty, 'bg' will be the average of two corner voxel intensities in original data. method (optional) - 1, 2, or 3 1: for Trilinear interpolation 2: for Nearest Neighbor interpolation 3: for Fischer's Bresenham interpolation 'method' is 1 if it is default or empty. new_img - transformed 2D image or 3D volume new_M - transformed affine matrix Example 1 (3D rotation): load mri.mat; old_img = double(squeeze(D)); old_M = [0.88 0.5 3 -90; -0.5 0.88 3 -126; 0 0 2 -72; 0 0 0 1]; new_img = affine(old_img, old_M, 2); [x y z] = meshgrid(1:128,1:128,1:27); sz = size(new_img); [x1 y1 z1] = meshgrid(1:sz(2),1:sz(1),1:sz(3)); figure; slice(x, y, z, old_img, 64, 64, 13.5); shading flat; colormap(map); view(-66, 66); figure; slice(x1, y1, z1, new_img, sz(1)/2, sz(2)/2, sz(3)/2); shading flat; colormap(map); view(-66, 66); Example 2 (2D interpolation): load mri.mat; old_img=D(:,:,1,13)'; old_M = [1 0 0; 0 1 0; 0 0 1]; new_img = affine(old_img, old_M, [.2 .4]); figure; image(old_img); colormap(map); figure; image(new_img); colormap(map); This program is inspired by: SPM5 Software from Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software Fischer, J., A. del Rio (2004).

With 'flip_lr.m', you can convert any ANALYZE or NIfTI (no matter 3D or 4D) file to a flipped NIfTI file. This is implemented simply by flipping the affine matrix in the NIfTI header.

When colormap is used, setcolorlevel option will be disabled automatically. setcolorlevel: If specified (must be no more than 256, and cannot be used for customized colormap), row number of colormap will be squeezed down to this level; otherwise, it will assume that setcolorlevel=256. sethighcolor: If specified, program will squeeze down the colormap, and allocate sethighcolor (an Mx3 matrix) to high-end portion of the colormap. The sum of M and setcolorlevel should be less than 256. If setcolormap option is used, sethighcolor will be inserted on top of the setcolormap, and the setcolorlevel option will be disabled automatically. setcbarminmax: if specified, the [min max] will be used to set the min and max of the colorbar, which does not include any data for highcolor. setvalue: If specified, setvalue.val (with the same size as the source data on solution points) in the source area setvalue.idx will be superimposed on the current nii image. So, the size of setvalue.val should be equal to the size of setvalue.idx. To use this feature, it needs single or double nii structure for background image. glblocminmax: If specified, pgm will use glblocminmax to calculate the colormap, instead of minmax of image. setbuttondown: If specified, pgm will evaluate the command after a click or slide action is invoked to the new view point. setcomplex: This option will decide how complex data to be displayed: 0 - Real part of complex data; 1 - Imaginary part of complex data; 2 - Modulus (magnitude) of complex data; If not specified, it will be set to 0 (Real part of complex data as default option.

Note that the background color and figure dimensions are reproduced (the latter approximately, and ignoring cropping & magnification) in the output file. For transparent background (and semi-transparent patch objects), use the -transparent option or set the figure 'Color' property to 'none'. To make axes transparent set the axes 'Color' property to 'none'. PDF, EPS and PNG are the only formats that support a transparent background, while only PNG format supports transparency of patch objects. The choice of renderer (opengl, zbuffer or painters) has a large impact on the quality of output. The default value (opengl for bitmaps, painters for vector formats) generally gives good results, but if you aren't satisfied then try another renderer. Notes: 1) For vector formats (EPS, PDF), only painters generates vector graphics. 2) For bitmaps, only opengl can render transparent patch objects correctly. 3) For bitmaps, only painters will correctly scale line dash and dot lengths when magnifying or anti-aliasing. 4) Fonts may be substitued with Courier when using painters. When exporting to vector format (PDF & EPS) and bitmap format using the painters renderer, this function requires that ghostscript is installed on your system. You can download this from: http://www.ghostscript.com When exporting to eps it additionally requires pdftops, from the Xpdf suite of functions. You can download this from: http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf Inputs: filename - string containing the name (optionally including full or relative path) of the file the figure is to be saved as. If a path is not specified, the figure is saved in the current directory. If no name and no output arguments are specified, the default name, 'export_fig_out', is used. If neither a file extension nor a format are specified, a \".png\" is added and the figure saved in that format. -format1, -format2, etc. - strings containing the extensions of the file formats the figure is to be saved as. Valid options are: '-pdf', '-eps', '-png', '-tif', '-jpg' and '-bmp'. All combinations of formats are valid. -nocrop - option indicating that the borders of the output are not to be cropped. -transparent - option indicating that the figure background is to be made transparent (png, pdf and eps output only). -m - option where val indicates the factor to magnify the on-screen figure pixel dimensions by when generating bitmap outputs (does not affect vector formats). Default: '-m1'. -r - option val indicates the resolution (in pixels per inch) to export bitmap and vector outputs at, keeping the dimensions of the on-screen figure. Default: '-r864' (for vector output only). Note that the -m option overides the -r option for bitmap outputs only. -native - option indicating that the output resolution (when outputting a bitmap format) should be such that the vertical resolution of the first suitable image found in the figure is at the native resolution of that image. To specify a particular image to use, give it the tag 'export_fig_native'. Notes: This overrides any value set with the -m and -r options. It also assumes that the image is displayed front-to-parallel with the screen. The output resolution is approximate and should not be relied upon. Anti-aliasing can have adverse effects on image quality (disable with the -a1 option). -a1, -a2, -a3, -a4 - option indicating the amount of anti-aliasing to use for bitmap outputs. '-a1' means no anti- aliasing; '-a4' is the maximum amount (default). - - option to force a particular renderer (painters, opengl or zbuffer). Default value: opengl for bitmap formats or figures with patches and/or transparent annotations; painters for vector formats without patches/transparencies. - - option indicating which colorspace color figures should be saved in: RGB (default), CMYK or gray. CMYK is only supported in pdf, eps and tiff output. -q - option to vary bitmap image quality (in pdf, eps and jpg files only). Larger val, in the range 0-100, gives higher quality/lower compression. val > 100 gives lossless compression. Default: '-q95' for jpg, ghostscript prepress default for pdf & eps. Note: lossless compression can sometimes give a smaller file size than the default lossy compression, depending on the type of images. -p - option to pad a border of width val to exported files, where val is either a relative size with respect to cropped image size (i.e. p=0.01 adds a 1% border). For EPS & PDF formats, val can also be integer in units of 1/72\" points (abs(val)>1). val can be positive (padding) or negative (extra cropping). If used, the -nocrop flag will be ignored, i.e. the image will always be cropped and then padded. Default: 0 (i.e. no padding). -append - option indicating that if the file (pdfs only) already exists, the figure is to be appended as a new page, instead of being overwritten (default). -bookmark - option to indicate that a bookmark with the name of the figure is to be created in the output file (pdf only). -clipboard - option to save output as an image on the system clipboard. Note: background transparency is not preserved in clipboard -d - option to indicate a ghostscript setting. For example, -dMaxBitmap=0 or -dNoOutputFonts (Ghostscript 9.15+). -depsc - option to use EPS level-3 rather than the default level-2 print device. This solves some bugs with Matlab's default -depsc2 device such as discolored subplot lines on images (vector formats only). -update - option to download and install the latest version of export_fig -nofontswap - option to avoid font swapping. Font swapping is automatically done in vector formats (only): 11 standard Matlab fonts are replaced by the original figure fonts.

Note that the background color and figure dimensions are reproduced (the latter approximately, and ignoring cropping & magnification) in the output file. For transparent background (and semi-transparent patch objects), use the -transparent option or set the figure 'Color' property to 'none'. To make axes transparent set the axes 'Color' property to 'none'. PDF, EPS and PNG are the only formats that support a transparent background, while only PNG format supports transparency of patch objects. The choice of renderer (opengl, zbuffer or painters) has a large impact on the quality of output. The default value (opengl for bitmaps, painters for vector formats) generally gives good results, but if you aren't satisfied then try another renderer. Notes: 1) For vector formats (EPS, PDF), only painters generates vector graphics. 2) For bitmaps, only opengl can render transparent patch objects correctly. 3) For bitmaps, only painters will correctly scale line dash and dot lengths when magnifying or anti-aliasing. 4) Fonts may be substitued with Courier when using painters. When exporting to vector format (PDF & EPS) and bitmap format using the painters renderer, this function requires that ghostscript is installed on your system. You can download this from: http://www.ghostscript.com When exporting to eps it additionally requires pdftops, from the Xpdf suite of functions. You can download this from: http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf Inputs: filename - string containing the name (optionally including full or relative path) of the file the figure is to be saved as. If a path is not specified, the figure is saved in the current directory. If no name and no output arguments are specified, the default name, 'export_fig_out', is used. If neither a file extension nor a format are specified, a \".png\" is added and the figure saved in that format. -format1, -format2, etc. - strings containing the extensions of the file formats the figure is to be saved as. Valid options are: '-pdf', '-eps', '-png', '-tif', '-jpg' and '-bmp'. All combinations of formats are valid. -nocrop - option indicating that the borders of the output are not to be cropped. -transparent - option indicating that the figure background is to be made transparent (png, pdf and eps output only). -m - option where val indicates the factor to magnify the on-screen figure pixel dimensions by when generating bitmap outputs (does not affect vector formats). Default: '-m1'. -r - option val indicates the resolution (in pixels per inch) to export bitmap and vector outputs at, keeping the dimensions of the on-screen figure. Default: '-r864' (for vector output only). Note that the -m option overides the -r option for bitmap outputs only. -native - option indicating that the output resolution (when outputting a bitmap format) should be such that the vertical resolution of the first suitable image found in the figure is at the native resolution of that image. To specify a particular image to use, give it the tag 'export_fig_native'. Notes: This overrides any value set with the -m and -r options. It also assumes that the image is displayed front-to-parallel with the screen. The output resolution is approximate and should not be relied upon. Anti-aliasing can have adverse effects on image quality (disable with the -a1 option). -a1, -a2, -a3, -a4 - option indicating the amount of anti-aliasing to use for bitmap outputs. '-a1' means no anti- aliasing; '-a4' is the maximum amount (default). - - option to force a particular renderer (painters, opengl or zbuffer). Default value: opengl for bitmap formats or figures with patches and/or transparent annotations; painters for vector formats without patches/transparencies. - - option indicating which colorspace color figures should be saved in: RGB (default), CMYK or gray. CMYK is only supported in pdf, eps and tiff output. -q - option to vary bitmap image quality (in pdf, eps and jpg files only). Larger val, in the range 0-100, gives higher quality/lower compression. val > 100 gives lossless compression. Default: '-q95' for jpg, ghostscript prepress default for pdf & eps. Note: lossless compression can sometimes give a smaller file size than the default lossy compression, depending on the type of images. -p - option to pad a border of width val to exported files, where val is either a relative size with respect to cropped image size (i.e. p=0.01 adds a 1% border). For EPS & PDF formats, val can also be integer in units of 1/72\" points (abs(val)>1). val can be positive (padding) or negative (extra cropping). If used, the -nocrop flag will be ignored, i.e. the image will always be cropped and then padded. Default: 0 (i.e. no padding). -append - option indicating that if the file (pdfs only) already exists, the figure is to be appended as a new page, instead of being overwritten (default). -bookmark - option to indicate that a bookmark with the name of the figure is to be created in the output file (pdf only). -clipboard - option to save output as an image on the system clipboard. Note: background transparency is not preserved in clipboard -d - option to indicate a ghostscript setting. For example, -dMaxBitmap=0 or -dNoOutputFonts (Ghostscript 9.15+). -depsc - option to use EPS level-3 rather than the default level-2 print device. This solves some bugs with Matlab's default -depsc2 device such as discolored subplot lines on images (vector formats only). -update - option to download and install the latest version of export_fig -nofontswap - option to avoid font swapping. Font swapping is automatically done in vector formats (only): 11 standard Matlab fonts are replaced by the original figure fonts. This option prevents this. handle - The handle of the figure, axes or uipanels (can be an array of handles, but the objects must be in the same figure) to be saved. Default: gcf. Outputs: imageData - MxNxC uint8 image array of the exported image. alpha - MxN single array of alphamatte values in the range [0,1], for the case when the background is transparent.

If the first input is a zip/tgz file, such as those downloaded from dicom server, DICM2NII will extract files into a temp folder, create NIfTI files into the data folder, and then delete the temp folder. For this reason, it is better to keep the compressed file as backup. If a folder is the data source, DICM2NII will convert all files in the folder and its subfolders (there is no need to sort files for different series). Please note that, if a file in the middle of a series is missing, the series will normally be skipped without converting, and a warning message in red text will be shown in Command Windows, and the message will also be saved into a text file under the data folder. For MoCo series, motion parameters, RBMoCoTrans and RBMoCoRot, are also saved. A Matlab data file, dcmHeaders.mat, is always saved into the data folder. This file contains dicom header from the first file for created series and some information from last file in field LastFile. Some extra information may also be saved into this file. Slice timing information, if available, is stored in nii header, such as slice_code and slice_duration. But the simple way may be to use the field SliceTiming in dcmHeaders.mat. That timing is actually those numbers for FSL when using custom slice timing. This is the universal method to specify any kind of slice order, and for now, is the only way which works for multiband. Slice order is one of the most confusing parameters, and it is recommended to use this method to avoid mistake. Following shows how to convert this timing into slice timing in ms and slice order for SPM: load('dcmHeaders.mat'); % or drag and drop the MAT file into Matlab s = h.myFuncSeries; % field name is the same as nii file name spm_ms = (0.5 - s.SliceTiming) * s.RepetitionTime; [~, spm_order] = sort(-s.SliceTiming); Some information, such as TE, phase encoding direction and effective dwell time are stored in descrip of nii header. These are useful for fieldmap B0 unwarp correction. Acquisition start time and date are also stored, and this may be useful if one wants to align the functional data to some physiological recording, like pulse, respiration or ECG. If there is DTI series, bval and bvec files will be generated for FSL etc. For DTI series, B_value and DiffusionGradientDirection for all directions are saved into the dcmHeaders.mat file. Starting from 20150514, the converter stores some useful information in NIfTI text extension (ecode=6). nii_tool can decode these information easily: ext = nii_tool('ext', 'myNiftiFile.nii'); % read NIfTI extension ext.edata_decoded contains all above mentioned information, and more. Please note that some information, such as the slice order information, phase encoding direction and DTI bvec are in image reference, rather than NIfTI coordinate system. This is because most analysis packages require information in image space. For this reason, in case the image in a NIfTI file is flipped or re-oriented, these information may not be correct anymore. The output file names adopt SeriesDescription or ProtocolName of each series used on scanner console. If both original and MoCo series are requested, '_MoCo' will be appended for MoCo series. For phase image, such as those from field map, '_phase' will be appended to the name. If multiple subjects data are mixed (strongly discouraged), subject name will be in file name. In case of name conflict, SeriesNumber, such as '_s005', will be appended to make file names unique. It is suggested to use short and descriptive SeriesDescription on the scanner console, and use names containing only letters, numbers and underscores. For SPM 3D files, the file names will have volume index in format of '_00001' appended to above name.

To get help information for each command, include '?' in cmd, for example: nii_tool init? nii_tool('init?') Here is a list of all command: nii_tool('default', 'version', 1, 'rgb_dim', 1); nii = nii_tool('init', img); nii_tool('save', nii, filename, force_3D); hdr = nii_tool('hdr', filename); img = nii_tool('img', filename_or_hdr); ext = nii_tool('ext', filename_or_hdr); nii = nii_tool('load', filename_or_hdr); nii = nii_tool('cat3D', filenames); nii_tool('RGBStyle', 'afni'); Detail for each command is described below. oldVal = nii_tool('default', 'version', 1, 'rgb_dim', 1); oldVal = nii_tool('default', struct('version', 1, 'rgb_dim', 1)); Set/query default NIfTI version and/or rgb_dim. To check the setting, run nii_tool('default') without other input. The input for 'default' command can be either a struct with fields of 'version' and/or 'rgb_dim', or parameter/value pairs. See nii_tool('RGBstyle') for meaning of rgb_dim. Note that the setting will be saved for future use. If one wants to change the settting temporarily, it is better to return the oldVal, and to restore it after done: oldVal = nii_tool('default', 'version', 2); % set version 2 as default % 'init' and 'save' NIfTI using above version nii_tool('default', oldVal); % restore default setting The default version setting affects 'init' command only. If you 'load' a NIfTI file, modify it, and then 'save' it, the version will be the same as the original file, unless it is changed explicitly (see help for 'save' command). All 'load' command ('load', 'hdr', 'ext', 'img') will read any version correctly, regardless of version setting. nii = nii_tool('init', img, RGB_dim); Initialize nii struct based on img, normally 3D or 4D array. Most fields in the returned nii.hdr contain default values, and need to be updated based on dicom or other information. Important ones include pixdim and s/qform_code and related parameters. The NIfTI datatype will depend on data type of img. Most Matlab data types are supported, including 8/16/32/64 bit signed and unsigned integers, single and double floating numbers. Single/double complex and logical array are also supported. nii_tool returns img with the same data type as it is stored, while numeric values in hdr are in double. This also applies to the struct returned by any nii_tool loading sub-functions. The optional third input is needed only if img contains RGB/RGBA data. It specifies which dimension in img is for RGB or RGBA. In other words, if a non-empty third input is provided, img will be interpreted as RGB or RGBA data. Another way to signify RGB/RGBA data is to permute color dim to 8th-dim of img (RGB_dim of 8 can be omitted then). Since NIfTI img can have up to 7 dim, nii_tool chooses to store RGB/RGBA in 8th dim. Although this looks lengthy (4th to 7th dim are often all ones), nii_tool can deal with up to 7 dim without causing any confusion. This is why the returned nii.img will always store RGB in 8th dim. hdr = nii_tool('hdr', filename); Return hdr struct of the provided NIfTI file. img = nii_tool('img', filename_or_hdr); Return image data in a NIfTI file. The second input can be NIfTI file name, or hdr struct returned by nii_tool('hdr', filename). ext = nii_tool('ext', filename_or_hdr); Return NIfTI extension in a NIfTI file. The second input can be NIfTI file name, or hdr struct returned by nii_tool('hdr', filename). The returned ext will have field 'edata_decoded' if 'ecode' is of known type, such as dicom (2), text (4 or 6) or Matlab (40). Here is an example to add data in myFile.mat as extension to nii struct, which can be from 'init' or 'load': fid = fopen('myFile.mat'); % open the MAT file myEdata = fread(fid, inf, '*uint8'); % load all bytes as byte column fclose(fid); len = int32(numel(myEdata)); % number of bytes in int32 myEdata = [typecast(len, 'uint8')'; myEdata]; % include len in myEdata nii.ext.ecode = 40; % 40 for Matlab extension nii.ext.edata = myEdata; % myEdata must be uint8 array nii_tool will take care of rest when you 'save' nii to a file. In case a NIfTI ext causes problem (for example, some FSL builds have problem in reading NIfTI img with ecode>30), one can remove the ext easily: nii = nii_tool('load', 'file_with_ext.nii'); % load the file with ext nii.ext = []; % or nii = rmfield(nii, 'ext'); % remove ext nii_tool('save', nii, 'file_without_ext.nii'); % save it nii = nii_tool('load', filename_or_hdr); Load NIfTI file into nii struct. The returned struct includes NIfTI 'hdr' and 'img', as well as 'ext' if the file contains NIfTI extension. nii_tool('save', nii, filename, force_3D); Save struct nii into filename. The format of the file is determined by the file extension, such as .img, .nii, .img.gz, .nii.gz etc. If filename is not provided, nii.hdr.file_name must contain a file name. Note that 'save' command always overwrites file in case of name conflict. If filename has no extension, '.nii' will be used as default. If the 4th input, force_3D, is true (default false), the output file will be 3D only, which means multiple volume data will be split into multiple files. This is the format SPM likes. You can use this command to convert 4D into 3D by 'load' a 4D file, then 'save' it as 3D files. The 3D file names will have 5-digit like '_00001' appended to indicate volume index. The NIfTI version can be set by nii_tool('default'). One can override the default version by specifying it in nii.hdr.version. To convert between versions, load a NIfTI file, specify new version, and save it. For example: nii = nii_tool('load', 'file_nifti1.nii'); % load version 1 file nii.hdr.version = 2; % force to NIfTI-2 nii_tool('save', nii, 'file_nifti2.nii'); % save as version 2 file Following example shows how to change data type of a nii file: nii = nii_tool('load', 'file_int16.nii'); % load int16 type file nii.img = single(nii.img); % change data type to single/float32 nii_tool('save', nii, 'file_float.nii'); % nii_tool will take care of hdr nii = nii_tool('cat3D', files); Concatenate SPM 3D files into a 4D dataset. The input 'files' can be cellstr with file names, or char with wildcards (* or ?). If it is cellstr, the volume order in the 4D data corresponds to those files. If wildcards are used, the volume order is based on alphabetical order of file names. Note that the files to be concatenated must have the same datatype, dim, voxel size, scaling slope and intercept, transformation matrix, etc. This is true if files are for the same series. Following example shows how to convert a series of 3D files into a 4D file: nii = nii_tool('cat3D', './data/fSubj2-0003*.nii'); % load files for series 3 nii_tool('save', nii, './data/fSubj2-0003_4D.nii'); % save as a 4D file oldStyle = nii_tool('RGBStyle', 'afni'); Set/query the method to save/load RGB or RGBA NIfTI file. The default method can be set by nii_tool('default', [version rgb_dim]), where rgb_dim can be 1, 3 or 4, as explained below. The default style is 'afni' style (or 1), which is defined by NIfTI standard, but is not well supported by fsl or mricron. If the second input is set to 'mricron' (or 3), nii_tool will save/load file using the old RGB fashion (dim 3 for RGB). This works for mricron at least till version 4 August 2014. If the second input is set to 'fsl' (or 4), nii_tool will save/load RGB or RGBA layer into 4th dimension (and the file is not encoded as RGB data, but as normal file).

To get help information for each command, include '?' in cmd, for example: nii_tool init? nii_tool('init?') Here is a list of all command: nii_tool('default', 'version', 1, 'rgb_dim', 1); nii = nii_tool('init', img); nii_tool('save', nii, filename, force_3D); hdr = nii_tool('hdr', filename); img = nii_tool('img', filename_or_hdr); ext = nii_tool('ext', filename_or_hdr); nii = nii_tool('load', filename_or_hdr); nii = nii_tool('cat3D', filenames); nii_tool('RGBStyle', 'afni'); Detail for each command is described below. oldVal = nii_tool('default', 'version', 1, 'rgb_dim', 1); oldVal = nii_tool('default', struct('version', 1, 'rgb_dim', 1)); Set/query default NIfTI version and/or rgb_dim. To check the setting, run nii_tool('default') without other input. The input for 'default' command can be either a struct with fields of 'version' and/or 'rgb_dim', or parameter/value pairs. See nii_tool('RGBstyle') for meaning of rgb_dim. Note that the setting will be saved for future use. If one wants to change the settting temporarily, it is better to return the oldVal, and to restore it after done: oldVal = nii_tool('default', 'version', 2); % set version 2 as default % 'init' and 'save' NIfTI using above version nii_tool('default', oldVal); % restore default setting The default version setting affects 'init' command only. If you 'load' a NIfTI file, modify it, and then 'save' it, the version will be the same as the original file, unless it is changed explicitly (see help for 'save' command). All 'load' command ('load', 'hdr', 'ext', 'img') will read any version correctly, regardless of version setting. nii = nii_tool('init', img, RGB_dim); Initialize nii struct based on img, normally 3D or 4D array. Most fields in the returned nii.hdr contain default values, and need to be updated based on dicom or other information. Important ones include pixdim and s/qform_code and related parameters. The NIfTI datatype will depend on data type of img. Most Matlab data types are supported, including 8/16/32/64 bit signed and unsigned integers, single and double floating numbers. Single/double complex and logical array are also supported. nii_tool returns img with the same data type as it is stored, while numeric values in hdr are in double. This also applies to the struct returned by any nii_tool loading sub-functions. The optional third input is needed only if img contains RGB/RGBA data. It specifies which dimension in img is for RGB or RGBA. In other words, if a non-empty third input is provided, img will be interpreted as RGB or RGBA data. Another way to signify RGB/RGBA data is to permute color dim to 8th-dim of img (RGB_dim of 8 can be omitted then). Since NIfTI img can have up to 7 dim, nii_tool chooses to store RGB/RGBA in 8th dim. Although this looks lengthy (4th to 7th dim are often all ones), nii_tool can deal with up to 7 dim without causing any confusion. This is why the returned nii.img will always store RGB in 8th dim. hdr = nii_tool('hdr', filename); Return hdr struct of the provided NIfTI file. img = nii_tool('img', filename_or_hdr); Return image data in a NIfTI file. The second input can be NIfTI file name, or hdr struct returned by nii_tool('hdr', filename). ext = nii_tool('ext', filename_or_hdr); Return NIfTI extension in a NIfTI file. The second input can be NIfTI file name, or hdr struct returned by nii_tool('hdr', filename). The returned ext will have field 'edata_decoded' if 'ecode' is of known type, such as dicom (2), text (4 or 6) or Matlab (40). Here is an example to add data in myFile.mat as extension to nii struct, which can be from 'init' or 'load': fid = fopen('myFile.mat'); % open the MAT file myEdata = fread(fid, inf, '*uint8'); % load all bytes as byte column fclose(fid); len = int32(numel(myEdata)); % number of bytes in int32 myEdata = [typecast(len, 'uint8')'; myEdata]; % include len in myEdata nii.ext.ecode = 40; % 40 for Matlab extension nii.ext.edata = myEdata; % myEdata must be uint8 array nii_tool will take care of rest when you 'save' nii to a file. In case a NIfTI ext causes problem (for example, some FSL builds have problem in reading NIfTI img with ecode>30), one can remove the ext easily: nii = nii_tool('load', 'file_with_ext.nii'); % load the file with ext nii.ext = []; % or nii = rmfield(nii, 'ext'); % remove ext nii_tool('save', nii, 'file_without_ext.nii'); % save it nii = nii_tool('load', filename_or_hdr); Load NIfTI file into nii struct. The returned struct includes NIfTI 'hdr' and 'img', as well as 'ext' if the file contains NIfTI extension. nii_tool('save', nii, filename, force_3D); Save struct nii into filename. The format of the file is determined by the file extension, such as .img, .nii, .img.gz, .nii.gz etc. If filename is not provided, nii.hdr.file_name must contain a file name. Note that 'save' command always overwrites file in case of name conflict. If filename has no extension, '.nii' will be used as default. If the 4th input, force_3D, is true (default false), the output file will be 3D only, which means multiple volume data will be split into multiple files. This is the format SPM likes. You can use this command to convert 4D into 3D by 'load' a 4D file, then 'save' it as 3D files. The 3D file names will have 5-digit like '_00001' appended to indicate volume index. The NIfTI version can be set by nii_tool('default'). One can override the default version by specifying it in nii.hdr.version. To convert between versions, load a NIfTI file, specify new version, and save it. For example: nii = nii_tool('load', 'file_nifti1.nii'); % load version 1 file nii.hdr.version = 2; % force to NIfTI-2 nii_tool('save', nii, 'file_nifti2.nii'); % save as version 2 file Following example shows how to change data type of a nii file: nii = nii_tool('load', 'file_int16.nii'); % load int16 type file nii.img = single(nii.img); % change data type to single/float32 nii_tool('save', nii, 'file_float.nii'); % nii_tool will take care of hdr nii = nii_tool('cat3D', files); Concatenate SPM 3D files into a 4D dataset. The input 'files' can be cellstr with file names, or char with wildcards (* or ?). If it is cellstr, the volume order in the 4D data corresponds to those files. If wildcards are used, the volume order is based on alphabetical order of file names. Note that the files to be concatenated must have the same datatype, dim, voxel size, scaling slope and intercept, transformation matrix, etc. This is true if files are for the same series. Following example shows how to convert a series of 3D files into a 4D file: nii = nii_tool('cat3D', './data/fSubj2-0003*.nii'); % load files for series 3 nii_tool('save', nii, './data/fSubj2-0003_4D.nii'); % save as a 4D file oldStyle = nii_tool('RGBStyle', 'afni'); Set/query the method to save/load RGB or RGBA NIfTI file. The default method can be set by nii_tool('default', [version rgb_dim]), where rgb_dim can be 1, 3 or 4, as explained below. The default style is 'afni' style (or 1), which is defined by NIfTI standard, but is not well supported by fsl or mricron. If the second input is set to 'mricron' (or 3), nii_tool will save/load file using the old RGB fashion (dim 3 for RGB). This works for mricron at least till version 4 August 2014. If the second input is set to 'fsl' (or 4), nii_tool will save/load RGB or RGBA layer into 4th dimension (and the file is not encoded as RGB data, but as normal file). This violates the NIfTI rule, but it seems it is the only way, for now (till fsl version 5.0.8), to work for fslview. If no new style (second input) is provided, it means to query the current style (one of 'afni', 'mricron' and 'fsl'). Following shows how to convert between mricron style and fsl style: nii_tool('RGBStyle', 'mricron'); % later load/save uses mricron style nii = nii_tool('load', 'mricronStyle.nii'); % load dim3-RGB file nii_tool('RGBStyle', 'fsl'); % switch to fsl style nii_tool('save', nii, 'fslRGB.nii'); % fsl can read it as RGB Note that, if one wants to convert fsl style (non-RGB file by NIfTI standard) to other styles, an extra step is needed to change the RGB dim from 4th to 8th dim before 'save': nii = nii_tool('load', 'fslStyleFile.nii'); % no need to set 'RGBStyle' nii.img = permute(nii.img, [1:3 5:8 4]); % force it to be RGB data nii_tool('RGBStyle', 'mricron'); % switch to RGB mricron style nii_tool('save', nii, 'mricronRGB.nii'); % now mricron can read it as RGB Also note that the setting by nii_tool('RGBStyle') is effective only for current Matlab session.

DEF is a string that specifies the type of head phantom to generate. Valid values are: 'Shepp-Logan' A test image used widely by researchers in tomography 'Modified Shepp-Logan' (default) A variant of the Shepp-Logan phantom in which the contrast is improved for better visual perception. N is a scalar that specifies the grid size of P. If you omit the argument, N defaults to 64. P = PHANTOM3D(E,N) generates a user-defined phantom, where each row of the matrix E specifies an ellipsoid in the image.
